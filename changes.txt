0) I fail to see that the example of Xenoturbella underlines this conclusion.
It just seems to illustrate that one needs to be able to correctly identify
the data used and that the phylogenetic placement of a leaf will be wrong if
not all relevant clades are included in the analysis.

DELETED: This unimpressive worm-like animal was classified as close relative of molluscs
based on DNA that, as it turned out later, represented its food rather than the animal itself. It was
later placed based on genome-wide sequencing data within the Deuterostomes, the animal clade
that also includes vertebrates (Bourlat et al., 2006), only to be demoted again earlier last year
to one of the most basal bilaterian branches by means of data for related species (Rouse et al.,
2016).

Partially new: "Of course no method is infallible with respect to the features chosen. If these are either too noisy to convey retrievable information or are not transmitted along the same tree to begin with, the reconstructed tree might not depict any actual relationships. An extreme example in the phylogeny of animals is the strange case of Xenoturbella, which was placed at vastly different positions in the animal tree based on different choices of data sets and taxa included for comparion (Bourlat et al., 2006; Rouse et al., 2016). This underlines the fundamental importance of basing phylogenetic reconstruction on multiple, independent feature sets because it is often not obvious a priori which features are informative for comparison in a given context.

1) What is lineage sorting?
Added a footnote: Incomplete lineage sorting describes the effect that for a small subset of the genome may contradicts the true phylogeny by being more similar to a more distant relative than to the, e.g., sister species. In the words of linguistics, some words in a language may be less similar to the cognate in the sister language than to the cognate in a more distantly related language.

2) This is a circular assessment (trees are useful when the data is sufficiently tree-like)
reply: Indeed: treelikeness can be quantified independent of phylogenetic reconstruction -- I included as review paper we recently wrote about this very issue. We should answer that this is indeed NOT circular.

NB: The use of the term "other forms of inheritance" does violence
  upon the term "inheritance". Presumably it refers to the mentioned
  cases where "lineages are not well-sorted" but it's never explained
  what that means in terms of an evolutionary process and whether it's
  a form of inheritance. -- \LM{the well-sorted should be explained
    with the footnote for the previous TODO. I also replaced the
    'other forms of inheritance' with 'other forms of
    relationships'. May be more generell and thus more inclusive.

changed to "forms of relationships" 
and added: "Several measures that quantify the of tree-likeness of a data set are available that do not presuppose a particular tree and hence can be employed without biasing subsequent phylogenetic statements (Bandelt and Dress, 1992; Nieselt-Struwe, 1997; Misof et al., 2014)."


3) (I am assuming "non-vertical inheritance" should be "non-vertical
  transmission".) The conclusion, however, does not follow from the
  citation. Bowern (2010) could have done the comparison between the
  borrowable and non-borrowable subset in the absense of any visualization
  at all, and the visualization used did not allow anyone to distinguish
  between retention/innovation and certainly did not give any
  quantification.

rewrote to: Nevertheless, they can be very
useful to visualize and quantify the contribution of non-vertical transmission (Holden and Gray,
2006; Bowern, 2010). Network graphs reflect relationships between languages given a distance
measure. Other than tree producing algorithms long branch attraction, that is, of two languages
that are both dissimilar to all other languages are usually grouped together, is no problem since the
problematic languages would be branching from the center directly. In particular this means that
languages without any information on mutual history would result in a star-like NeighborNet.
In contrast, languages that share a root are grouped together via rectangular branches. Hence, for
languages that share unusually long branches than would be expected, borrowings are a reasonable
explanation.


4) This is an important point which, unfortunately, is not developed in the paper. It would be great to be told how measuring the goodness of fit of various tree-models tells us whether a non-tree model fits better or worse. Also, the suggested paradigm of looking at the posterior in Bayesian settings conflates effects due to the desired quantity (tree-like-ness) and other things estimated (branch lengths, rates of change etc).

rewrote "It is often better, therefore, to stick to a tree-based phylogenetic techniques but express the potential existence of reticulation or conflicts by measures of goodness of fit, for example, through low likelihoods in particular branches, a wide spread in the posterior distributions in Bayesian settings or explicit measures of reticulation when network approaches are applied to the same data (Robinson and Holton, 2012)." 
NOW: "In particular, low likelihoods in particular branches and a wide spread in the posterior distributions in Bayesian settings may be caused not only by insufficient signal but also by reticulate patterns
in the data. It is advisable, therefore, to compute explicit measures of tree-likeness (Bandelt and Dress, 1992; Nieselt-Struwe, 1997) and to use methods that reconstruct reticulate networks alongside with tree reconstruction methods. The latter also can provide direct measures of the amount of reticulation when network approaches are applied to the same data (Robinson and Holton, 2012)."


5) The logic here is unclear. Cf. the comment above that we never actually
told how only using tree-models tells us whether they are appropriate
or not. But suppose we did, then the authors suggest we can systematically
improve the tree-model by extending it to become ARGs. Then why not use
ARGs to begin with? (That would be systematic, rather than ad hoc).

This graded approach of considering only a dominant subset of effects is a general feature of statistical methods. Standard techniques exist to compare the predictive capability of incomplete models whose parameters are well constrained by the data available against complex models that cannot be so constrained. Furthermore, since typically the vertical inheritance arises from starkly dierent processes like population migration and fission than contact phenomena that lead to horizontal influences, building trees rather than reticulated networks allows us to answer the former questions even when the data are not sufficient to parameterize the entire process.


6) "Lexicostatistics and language phylogenetics." is mislabeled
because half of it is devoted to non-lexical phylogenies.

Renamed section to "Linguistic phylogenies."


7) {What is meant by "very good fit"? The whole paper argues we should
use quantification to answer such questions but for some reason
when we need it and it is easy to do, they don't do it. For example
what is the Robinson-Foulds distance between the computational and
"known linguistic history"-tree topologies in the cited papers? (And
why cite these, esp Dunn et al 2011, rather than all studies with
this metholodogy)

8) In addition, machine learning approaches have been used in reconstructing ancient word forms (Bouchard-Côté et al., 2013) "This information belongs in the
section about lexicon." and in phylogenetic analysis of typological features (Gell-Mann and Ruhlen, 2011; Dunn et al., 2011). "There is no machine
learning in the standard sense of the term in the two cited papers."

9) Small or moderate size word lists contain only very limited
numbers of cognates, particularly for the more distant languages. 
"What do you mean by "the more distant languages"? I could imagine 
this being true for poorly attested languages, and languages
in families where the general level of documentation is poor."

10) These studies do not "prove genealogical persistence", they are circular in this respect since they assume families established on the assumption of genealogical persistence of the very same vocabulary items...

several changes:

a) The core or basic vocabulary comprising the Swadesh concepts when compiled into such word lists is particularly suited for the phylogenetic enterprise for two reasons.

deleted reference to Swadesh list: "The core or basic vocabulary when compiled into such word lists is particularly suited for the phylogenetic enterprise for two reasons."

b) discussion point on Swadesh lists added: Even though Swadesh lists offer an initial starting point, the manner in which they were created and compiled had its shortcomings (Hoijer, 1956)

c) changes proven genealogical persistence to  plausible genealogical
persistence

d) TODO Tanmoy: why are word lists still a useful?


11) Importantly, though cognate judgments made purely from the phonetic structure captured in these semantically aligned word lists can be improved with specialized linguistic knowledge, in recent tests on ‘simple’ language families, the difference was found to have no systematic structure that could bias the reconstruction of phylogenies based on this data (Steiner et al., 2011; Hruschka et al., 2015). "Rephrase from Importantly on."

DID WE REPHRASE??? 
added: "For a comparison of different cognate detection algorithms see List et al. (2017b)."


12) Leaving the sequences of characters to be handled later leaves the reader wondering, at this point in the paper, how this will be resolved. A reference to where it is resolved would be useful.

added: "An example for how to solve this issue will be discussed in section 3.5 below."

13) This is the first mention of the term "scoring model" in this section, I believe. Because this is a very important concept
for this section I recommend that you introduce it in caps (in keeping 
with other technical terms), and provide a brief definition. Alternatively the term could be introduced in the first paragraph of the sub-section, since it is indeed the focus of this sub-section.

rewrote: "it is the construction of good scoring models, that is, a
function or look up table providing a measurement for the similarity or distance of observed phonemes/characters, that is most difficult in language comparisons.


14) What evidence supports this claim that there is sufficient signal 
in real cognate pair alignments for correct sound correspondences to be identified in spite of some false positives/wrong alignments?

TODO Tanmoy


15) The text and formulas here are ambiguous as to whether sigma and nscore are defined of a pair of languages or a pair of words from two lgs.  Presumably the latter but actually the sigma formula as written contains free variables that ranged over the full set of pairs between two languages on the previous page. Formulas are used for clarity so please be explicit as to what is defined over what and the domains of free variables.

NEW: Based on this, one can proceed to define the total score σ(u, v) of two words u from language A and v from language B as the sum of the scores of all aligned bigrams and the score contributions involving gaps, that is, insertions or deletions of characters. We can write this in form

σ_AB (u, v) = sum over all σ_AB (α, β) for all α∈u aligned with β∈v

noting that the gap contributions can also be encoded as pairs of formal bigrams that contain one or more gap characters, as shown in the example in Fig. 3. This ansatz makes it possible also to account for cases in which one sound/character in one language corresponds to two in another. The collection of the parameters σ AB (α, β) completely defines the scoring model for the comparison of languages A and B. In order to account for differences in the length of alignments, it is preferrable to used a normalized similarity score (nscore) obtained by dividing σ by the number of score contributions. In the case of bigram alignments this amounts nscore = σ/l, where l is the length of alignment without ˆ and $. The normalized values of σ AB (u, v) are naturally interpreted as average similarity per alignment column.

16) The reader may be left wondering about situations where one sound/symbol in language A corresponds to two in language B (e.g. Spanish puerta - Italian porta, or instances where two symbols correspond to a single sound in one language). This is one of the reasons that I recommend consolidating the discussion of representational issues and being more explicit about what "gaps" are in this method.

See 15)


17) Which 11 I-E lgs and why those (and, not, say, a single pair). This matters as the results should look quite different for distantly vs closely related pairs of languages.

added the reference to the appendix where the languages are listed "(Table B3)". These were chosen since we chose an example from a previous study.


18) Word boundaries aren't really an 'imperfect proxy' for syllable 
boundaries. Rather, they are a restricted subset of syllable boundaries
that are recoverable from orthographic representations.

TODO Damian: any further idea to Lydias edits?


19)But cognacy is a yes/no property and modeled as such in the work
the authors cite, so the inability to provide a yes/no answer is
incompleteness rather than a virtue.

NEW: "Even though cognacy itself is a binary property, keeping track of the weight of evidence that establishes a set as cognate is essential to any quantitative further analyses based on cognate sets. Proper procedures for propagating uncertainties from one stage of the calculation to the next is a key strength of formal methods we advocate."


20) These [local transpositions] were assumed to be so few as to negligible earlier in the paper so that is not much of an improvement. But if it were important to capture them, k >= 3 is not necessary as adding transposition operations to the Needleman Wunsch algorithm still keeps it polynominal.

added: "Transpositions, for instance, could be built explicitly into the pairwise alignment algorithms (Kruskal, 1983; Oommen and Loke, 1997). They are difficult parametrize due to the need of an explicit comarison of alternative evolutionary models for the same alignment data." [...] "One of the advantages of this approach is that it identifies transpositions without additional effort."


21) It should be mentioned that i) the results do not necessarily generalize to deeper families/cognacy and ii) that cognates in the Hruschka et al 2015 come in sets whereas the method described in the paper identifies cognates pairwise and may thus give inconsistent results of the type A is cognate with B and B is cognate with C but A is not cognate with C.

22) It's more customary to present the f-score of the precision/recall
corresponding to the different threshold values...

a) replaced 'It is customary to' with 'One can'
b) Since the ROC curves show intrinsic properties of the test—displaying the sensitivity and specificity as a function of threshold—various other summary statistics like precision, recall, or the customary f-score can be derived from it if one knows the total fraction of positives in the data set.


23) do you mean the "alternative"

TODO Damian


24) These methods aren't equivalent from a traditional historical 
linguist's perspective, and probably wouldn't deserve any lengthy discussion as alternatives if they were truly equivalent. Perhaps a different word choice or a modifier on "equivalent" would make more sense here.

TODO Damian


25) Later in the paper sound change processes are argued be universal (a la Ohala) which means that there is a specific answer to the incertitude expressed in the above passage.

added: "Again, such data-driven approaches are agnostic as to whether the sound change processes are indeed universal across all language families. In stead, given any data set, one can determine the weight of evidence for unique processes in each language family (or other classification unit), versus universal,
but probabilistic, laws that are variously instantiated in the families."


26) The "regular correspondences" you refer to here are the same as the "table of regular correspondences" you mention on line 41 of page 12, correct? I suspect that some historical linguists will expect that all uses of the term "regular" in relation to sound changes/correspondences will mean "regular" in the strict Neogrammarian
sense. It would be good to be explicit somewhere in this sub-section
about whether "regular correspondences" does in fact mean "exceptionless" as in the Neogrammarian usage.

added: "At the same time, neither method makes a methodological commitment to the strict Neogrammarian position of exception-free regular correspondences, nor can they distinguish between true sporadic change and undetected rare, but regular, contexts. The only structural commitment is that regular correspondences could provide a better explanation of the observed data than independent processes acting on each item in the lexicon. In fact, within the likelihood framework, simple analyses based on Akaike Information Criteria (Akaike, 1974) or Bayesian Information Criteria (Schwarz, 1978) readily show that the increase in explanatory power of regular correspondences outweighs the added model complexity (Hruschka et al., 2015)."


27) Reference here is needed to Bouchard-Cote's book but, even more so,
a justification for the totally unspported claim that it is feasible
from a computational point of view is needed...

added a phrase: While this is becoming feasible at least from a computational point of view, "as examplified by large-scale applications of Bayesian methods and ancestral state reconstruction methods to resolving essentially analogous questions in a biological setting (Bouchard-Côté et al., 2012; Joy et al., 2016)," it may not be the most efficient approach to analyzing the data.


28) This is an important question, but unfortunately not prudently discussed in this passage. Since the components depend on each other, it is not probabilistically correct to do it in the iterative manner,
and, as argued elsewhere in the paper (p 16) it is not a correct approach from the perspective of propagating uncertainty.

TODO Tanmoy
rewrote partially: This separation of tasks is a matter of computational efficiency and expediency "at our current computational capability". In fact, both maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony methods necessarily use this kind of separation internally: likelihoods or parsimony scores are computed for a given tree, and then used to compare trees. "The question is actually of propagating the alignment uncertainty into phylogenetic reconstruction".

28) Please explain what experience from computational biology shows how
this is helpful if not for computational efficiency and expediency? As
the text stands this claim is completelty unsupported. 

added/rewrote: Experience from computational biology shows that "though methods that attempt
to concurrently estimate alignments and phylogenetic trees (Lunter et al., 2005; Herman et al.,
2014) can be devised and applied with success, it appears to gain little in accuracy over the com-
mon practise of treating alignment and phylogeny reconstructing as independent tasks and often
does not justify the high experimental costs."


29) How do you know the subgrouping in Bowern, 2012; Bowern and
Atkinson, 2012 is reliable? The data is not given, the tree inference
method uses exactly the tree priors taken over blindly from biology
that the present paper warns about, and is squarely at odds with the
flat subgrouping espoused by the earlier non-computational work.

NB: reconstruction of the subgrouping is misphrased, presumbly
just "subgrouping" is meant as there is no reconstruction in
those papers.

30) It is not entirely clear what this sentence means, or how to evaluate the claim here without knowing exactly what you mean by 'random' mutations in this linguistic context. Do you mean sporadic changes? Either some clarification or a reference to some supporting discussion would be very helpful.

added: Similarity serves only as a first filter for relatedness. In fact, the rate of ‘random’ mutations "(either sporadic changes or misconstruction of rare processes)" variously affecting the sounds in individual words is so low that the method of comparative historical linguistics stipulates that only regular correspondences can be invoked to support the recent relatedness of languages.


31) Do you mean "typographical errors"? As written, the meaning of this sentence is unclear.

TODO Damian


32) {Please explain what this HMM does? (HMM is an extremely general technique for sequences and it is not obvious how they can be used in the manner mentioned).

adde "The key idea there is that horizontally acquired genes have different nucleotide patterns, which are detectable by a model trained to distinguish vertically transmitted from other sequences.  Differences in patterns of sound correspondences should be detectable by the same approach. It will remain to be seen whether this" can be successful in cases of large scale borrowing.


33) This idea is limited by regularities in the meaning space of the kind discussed in 4.1-4.2 (as well as synonyms). The paper would make an actual contribution if this was taken seriously for a correct
assessment of number emanating from a permutation test.

TODO Tanmoy: do you know know what could be meant here?


34) Is the math correct here? 7 x 6 / 2 = 21 according to me.

35) Do alphabetic scripts do that? Or is segmental phonology rather than "phonetics" intended?

TODO Damian


36) The final sentence of this paragraph needs to be reworded for clarity.

changed: We found that 97% of the "cognate pairs computationally proposed in the data with of the encodings are also identified in the other one (see Fig. 9a), suggesting that the computational machinery is largely unaffected by details of the encoding."


37) This conclusion should be qualified by the fact that only closely related languages were used in the tests. Of course, then a small amoutn of error drowns in the flood cognates. More interesting would be to assess the impact in a case where the error amound would compete against a similarly small amount of cognates.

added: "It is to be admitted, however, that these robustness results might change as one looks at lists with substantially lower frequency of cognates, as expected for deeper families or languages undergoing large amount of lexical replacement."

TODO Damian: is there a paper by List? 


38) Is this a language independent result?

added: The most efficient use of lexical data for determining deep language relationships, therefore, should weight the stable words and "sounds (e.g., consonants in most language families) more."

41) None of these paper support the idea of rate constancy, they support (emprirically) the idea of rate regularity.

Rate constancy has been severely criticized since early on (Bergsland and Vogt, 1962; Blust, 2000), "although some support for the idea of a constant rate of a change within particular subsets of the basic lexicon, or at least for that of certain chronological regularities in
lexical evolution, is still found in empirical evidence" (Ehret, 2000; Starostin, 2000, 2013; Holman et al., 2011).


42) It is never declared how synonyms are treated in the IDS and in the
experiments of Section 4 and how prevalent that is.

addition to the IDS chapter:
"All "the" word list"s" are kept in the same format, and the organization is based on Buck’s dictionary (Buck, 1949) which was topically subdivided into 23 chapters and had in total about 1200 potential entries for each word list. The IDS revised the chapter structure such that the IDS word lists have potentially 22 chapters and in total 1310 potential entries "(or more, since multiple synonyms are allowed for a single term if it is difficult to elicit one perfect equivalent for the general meaning of the entry)"."


43) As it is written this is two assumptions. Actually the first is
the definition of paralogous and what you assume is the second
one (that only paralogous cognates have sim in form and meaning).

We make the assumption that paralogous cognates inherit both their phonological form and their meaning from a common
ancestor. Paralogy is a concept diffent from polysemy: paralogous words are by definition distinct, and thus phologically distinguished, lexical items.  Conversely, we assume that a simultaneous similarity
(but not equality) of meaning and phonological form, if not
explanable by chance, can result only from paralogous cognates, \ie{}
processes such sound symbolism are sufficiently weak that they can be
ignored for this purpose.


44) The removal of identical words is contrary to the stated interest
which was "This element of cognacy across meaning category is
analogous to an important mode of biological evolution—the duplication
and subsequent functional divergence of genes.". Surely identical
words are (always or sometimes) instances of this process. For example,
mouse is an animal and now also a computer device, with its own life
in the different senses (e.g., the computer device can have a different
plural).

should be clarified in changes from 43.


45) I cannot find any information on the EHL website cited here

47) Though analogical change is sometimes treated as a "garbage bin" of marginal, non-regular changes, the phenomenon is really not that rare (certainly not in the same class of unusual "phonetic processes" as metathesis, though of course metathesis can happen by analogy...). Non-regular does not mean rare. Nor is it the case that analogical changes are inherently non-regular. It's a little unclear, therefore, exactly what you are trying to single out here as being poorly handled by these methods.

rewrote: Even though these methods do not currently "explicitly" incorporate "the regularities in" rare phonetic processes like metathesis and "other irregular processes like" analogical change "(treating them, rather, as instances of independent sporadic changes)", nor do they evaluate the reasonableness of the phonetic system in their inferences, such additional processes and constraints are reasonably straightforward to add in when and where they become important.

describe\NEW

the

if

we

However,
if

the

we

give

based
on
the

macro:->In
a
deeper
analysis,
the
consideration
is
not
only
one
of
practicality

also
of
principle.
Much
of
the
purpose
of
quantitative
methods
is
to
demand
a
formal
statement
of
the
assumptions
underlying
a
historical
reconstruction.
Ineffables,
or
evidence
external
to
the
data
that
can
admit
multiple
interpretations,
resist
such
formalization.
Quantitative
modeling
forces
the
modeler
to
accept
that
if
a
few
features
cannot
be
explained
without
reference
to
a
much
more
complex
context
than
the
evidence
within
the
data
itself,
and
if
that
context
is
ambiguous
or
subject
to
dispute,
the
model
should
adopt
a
least-biased
assumption
consistent
with
other
assumptions
that
have
been
made
in
definite
form
as
commitments
of
the

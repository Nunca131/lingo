in
word
lists
derived
from
standard

several
automatic
regularizations
are

Among
them
is
the
removal

We
report
words
here

macro:->The
confidence
interval
describe
the
range
of
a
parameter
in
which
one
expects
the
true
value
for
this
parameter
to
lie.
For
example,
if
we
would
know
that
there
are
differences
in
the
rates
with
which
sound
changes
happen,
we
could
ignore
the
differences
since
they
are
very
small.
However,
if
we
know
about
the
size
of
the
difference
we
could
give
the
confidence
interval
for
the
results
based
on
the
size
of
the
differences
and
observed
data
points.

macro:->In
a
deeper
analysis,
the
consideration
is
not
only
one
of
practicality
but
also
of
principle.
Much
of
the
purpose
of
quantitative
methods
is
to
demand
a
formal
statement
of
the
assumptions
underlying
a
historical
reconstruction.
Ineffables,
or
evidence
external
to
the
data
that
can
admit
multiple
interpretations,
resist
such
formalization.
Quantitative
modeling
forces
the
modeler
to
accept
that
if
a
few
features
cannot
be
explained
without
reference
to
a
much
more
complex
context
than
the
evidence
within
the
data
itself,
and
if
that
context
is
ambiguous
or
subject
to
dispute,
the
model
should
adopt
a
least-biased
assumption
consistent
with
other
assumptions
that
have
been
made
in
definite
form
as
commitments
of
the
model.

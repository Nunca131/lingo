Comments to the Author
I am not sure what the paper at hand is attemping to achieve. Its
title and abstract talk about a big data sanctioned methological shift
and as such it has the characteristics of a survey paper, whereas the
bulk of the paper is about a specific method for cognate detection and
some satellite empirical questions.  The overarching argument that
quantification promises a superior future doesn't come out very well
when the paper is full of hedged or vague claims of the sort that
quantification is supposed to resolve (such and such is useful, may be
useful, works well, experience shows etc etc) and that the authors do
not understand or have not read many of the papers they cite properly.

Although it contains a number of sensible observations it does not really
fulfil the role of a survey paper since it carries much eclectic,
uncritical,
promissory and platitudinal information. Other existing survey papers cover
the issues touched by the present paper equally or better:

Levinson, Stephen C. and Russell D. Gray. 2012. Tools
from evolutionary biology shed new light on the diversification
of languages. Trends in Cognitive Sciences 16(3):167–173. (unsuited? Nancy)

Also on the matter of cognate identification, there's really not much that
stands out in the present paper as opposed to the existing literature (which
the authors are not sufficiently familiar with) but there are some
experiments
in here that are of minor value.

Since I fail to see a major contribution of this paper I think its
publication would be largely redundant. To make the best use of the
contents of it I would recommend the authors to contemplate its
purpose. Is it a survey of big data in historical linguistics? Then do
it properly (define, cite all lines of work, be critical). If it is a
survey of big data in **lexical** historical linguistics this might
make the task smaller. Is the paper about cognate identification? Then
do this fully and leave the more general concerns about computers vs
manual work for elsewhere. Is the paper an enlightenment in general that
you can make use of quantification/statistics if you have a computer
and a lot of data? This is trivial, don't write such a paper.

The paper uses the term 'language evolution' is the narrow sense of
'linguistic change in the last few thousand years' (for which there's
already the established term 'historical linguistics' within linguistics).
This is probably deliberate.

Detailed comments:


* The passage "Nevertheless, it seems safe to assume that spoken
languages include a set of core features that are mainly uniparentally
co-inherited with occasional horizontal influences from other speech
communities. Such vertically inherited features range from phonetics
to individual lexical items and entire grammatical structures. Just
like the genotype comprising a biological system has a core subset of
housekeeping genes that form a bundle that is frequently, but not
always, co-inherited, it is likely that language has a core that can
be used to define a vertical descent."

directly contradicts that of the next page

"in fact we shall studiously refrain from privileging a single
co-inheritance bundle as the defining feature of genetic relationship
of a cultural trait such as language"

If you assume that there is a set of core features that define vertical
descent (and you venture to say it draws from phonology (probably not
phonetics!), lexicon and grammar!) there exists such a privileged bundle,
and by the logic of the paper you should be looking for it. Probably
the authors want to say that they do want to privilege a core set of
features for gauging vertical transmission, they just do not know which
this set is, and to find out is a key task.

But one does not need to assume so much as the question has been
studied empirically and there are lots of partial results in various
linguistic papers that should have been cited.

* P 11 re the peak structure

No explanation is offered as to i) why the peak for non-cognates is
negative appx -2 (rather than 0) and ii) why the Guaycuruan and IE datasets
behave differently.


* p 28

* "Based on this data, researchers have argued about the unity or
diversity of Tasmanian languages, with perhaps the most widely
accepted opinion being that linguistic analysis can lead at most to
rejecting the idea that Tasmanian languages constitute a single
linguistic family (Crowley and Dixon, 1981)."

"By using a combination of methods from evolutionary
biology—prominently, phylogenetic inference—Bowern was able to gather
enough evidence for 4/5 groupings (tentatively referred as
macro-families) present in the wordlists that correspond somewhat with
earlier archaeological classifications,"

"Not only did the usage of methods from evolutionary biology allow
Bowern to determine the number and extension of putative genealogical
groups among the Tasmanian languages, but, more importantly, the usage
of those methods lead to a natural quantification of uncertainty—so,
for instance, while the evidence for a common ancestry of two of the
inferred groups (those from Bruny Island and Oyster Bay) is strong,
the estimate of the common root age is extremely imprecise, ranging
from anywhere from 2,000 ybp to 20,000 ybp or more."

These three passages are completely mistaken. The philological work
by Dixon & Crowley 1981 is very similar to Bowern (2012) it's just that
Bowern (2010) probably did a more thorough job (one has to hope, the
data is not in the paper). The conlusions are very similar too, the
only difference is that the strictly quantitative aspects ended in
Dixon & Crowley 1981 with cognate density figures. Just like Bowern
the reserve judgment on many of the worst attested doculects (Bowerns
extended analysis only applies to the subsets with more than 100
items).

All the conclusions in Bowern (2012) quoted in the paper at hand can
be reached with accurate figures of the pairwise cognate desnities and
permutation tests. The phylogenetic methods used by Bowern (2012) were
used wrongly, in ways the present paper warns against. Structure has a
model of admixture which obviously incorrect for the evolution of
linguistic data (where we have trees, as also argued in the paper)
rather than random sampling from a number of pools. (Only in the case
of source mixing may this warranted, and that does concern a few
Tasmanian vocabularies, but that does not motivate its usage for
questions of descent, e.g., inferring the number of families.)
Furthermore the K is not compared to the prior in Bowern (2012)
application and so it not warranted solely by the data anyway.

The number of genealogical groups among the Tasmanian languages was
reached by Bowern (2012) with elementary means: simply "too few
cognates" uniting all groups that are not arguably borrowings/recent
introductions.  If she had followed the phylogenetic method she
(mis)applied the conclusion would indeed have been that they formed
one family spoken 20000 to 2000 years ago. Not 5 families, one family.
Not one family with such and such uncertainty concerning the number
one, but one family with full certainty, only a lof of uncertainty
about its age. That's what the phylogenetic methods she applied says,
but sensibly, she choose to ignore that conclusion (as it springs from
a misapplied monogenetic model, though the does not say that out loud).

* p 31-32

* The so-called North Caucasian family consists of languages in
North-East Caucasian family only.

Comments to the Author
This paper outlines methods and workflows for using large datasets to
perform phylolinguistic analyses. With some reorganization and adjustments
to the writing, this will be a very valuable contribution to the Journal of
Language Evolution. Below are some general comments regarding the
organization and writing of the article. Further detailed comments are
included in the attached file.

In general the writing of this piece tends toward the verbose end of the
spectrum, which in some places muddies the message being presented. I
recommend that the author(s) aim for maximally clear and concise text in
the revision process, especially in sections that present background
information. Some specific comments on writing and typos are included in
the attached file.

The extent to which individual technical terms and concepts are explained
is quite variable and may not in all cases be appropriate for the  target
audience. Some linguistic concepts that most people interested in language
evolution will be familiar with are fleshed out in great detail (e.g. the
notion of basic vocabulary as a more reliable source of phylogenetic signal
than other areas of the lexicon - p. 6), while other terms (including
technical terminology central to the methods discussed) are used without
being clearly introduced and defined (e.g. "pre-alignment", which appears
by p. 9, but is introduced with small caps and sketchy definition only on
p. 12 --- already in text).

The introduction section provides plenty of general background on
phylolinguistic traditions and their relationships to biology, but at the
expense of clearly introducing the content of the article -- namely, the
use of specific computational methods for answering questions in historical
linguistics using large datasets. I recommend condensing the discussion of
the history of phylogenetics and outlining the main focus of the
contribution within the first paragraph or two.

The issues of orthographic representation and level of phonetic detail are
discussed briefly in Section 3.2, and are then re-introduced and discussed
in further detail in Section 3.5. Between the two is a lengthy discussion
of alignment, scoring, tree reconstruction, and statistical tests. This
organization seems disjointed, particularly because the issue of sound
representation is so important to the matter of alignment. I recommend
consolidating the discussion of representations and presenting all
theoretical discussion relatively early in Section 3 (perhaps in the
beginning of Section 3.2, or in a new section in that vicinity). The IDS
example might make more of an impact if it referred back to a single,
concise discussion of representational issues instead of including its own
lengthy introductory discussion of these issues.

Section 3.7 seems out of place and wordier than it needs to be. The point
that computational methods can supplement or assist with traditional
historical linguistics has already been made, including the notion that
they can be used to overcome data limitations (e.g. the  Bowern reference
on p. 13). As the admixture model and NeighborNet methods central to Bowern
2012 aren't directly discussed in this article, it seems like an odd
example to devote so much space to. I would reconsider whether this section
is necessary at all, especially since Section 3.8 segues abruptly back to
methodological matters. (diesen Teil wieder loeschen? Auch R1 hat hier mit Probleme!)



Page 16, lines 11-25: This paragraph is a bit dense, and might be easier to read if some of the ideas were rephrased or "unpacked" a bit. (I don't get the enumeration of lines... Nancy)


Awkward wording:

Page 6, lines 27-32: This sentence is long and difficult to parse without a second reading. I recommend rewording it. (Kann ich auch auf umliegenden Seiten nicht finden? Nancy)

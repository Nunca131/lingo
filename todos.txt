Comments to the Author
I am not sure what the paper at hand is attemping to achieve. Its
title and abstract talk about a big data sanctioned methological shift
and as such it has the characteristics of a survey paper, whereas the
bulk of the paper is about a specific method for cognate detection and
some satellite empirical questions.  The overarching argument that
quantification promises a superior future doesn't come out very well
when the paper is full of hedged or vague claims of the sort that
quantification is supposed to resolve (such and such is useful, may be
useful, works well, experience shows etc etc) and that the authors do
not understand or have not read many of the papers they cite properly.

Although it contains a number of sensible observations it does not really
fulfil the role of a survey paper since it carries much eclectic,
uncritical,
promissory and platitudinal information. Other existing survey papers cover
the issues touched by the present paper equally or better:

Also on the matter of cognate identification, there's really not much that
stands out in the present paper as opposed to the existing literature (which
the authors are not sufficiently familiar with) but there are some
experiments
in here that are of minor value.

Since I fail to see a major contribution of this paper I think its
publication would be largely redundant. To make the best use of the
contents of it I would recommend the authors to contemplate its
purpose. Is it a survey of big data in historical linguistics? Then do
it properly (define, cite all lines of work, be critical). If it is a
survey of big data in **lexical** historical linguistics this might
make the task smaller. Is the paper about cognate identification? Then
do this fully and leave the more general concerns about computers vs
manual work for elsewhere. Is the paper an enlightenment in general that
you can make use of quantification/statistics if you have a computer
and a lot of data? This is trivial, don't write such a paper.

The paper uses the term 'language evolution' is the narrow sense of
'linguistic change in the last few thousand years' (for which there's
already the established term 'historical linguistics' within linguistics).
This is probably deliberate.

Detailed comments:


* The passage "Nevertheless, it seems safe to assume that spoken
languages include a set of core features that are mainly uniparentally
co-inherited with occasional horizontal influences from other speech
communities. Such vertically inherited features range from phonetics
to individual lexical items and entire grammatical structures. Just
like the genotype comprising a biological system has a core subset of
housekeeping genes that form a bundle that is frequently, but not
always, co-inherited, it is likely that language has a core that can
be used to define a vertical descent."

directly contradicts that of the next page

"in fact we shall studiously refrain from privileging a single
co-inheritance bundle as the defining feature of genetic relationship
of a cultural trait such as language"

If you assume that there is a set of core features that define vertical
descent (and you venture to say it draws from phonology (probably not
phonetics!), lexicon and grammar!) there exists such a privileged bundle,
and by the logic of the paper you should be looking for it. Probably
the authors want to say that they do want to privilege a core set of
features for gauging vertical transmission, they just do not know which
this set is, and to find out is a key task.

But one does not need to assume so much as the question has been
studied empirically and there are lots of partial results in various
linguistic papers that should have been cited.

* P 11 re the peak structure

No explanation is offered as to i) why the peak for non-cognates is
negative appx -2 (rather than 0) and ii) why the Guaycuruan and IE datasets
behave differently.

* p 10-14 on the cognate detection algorithm.

The method described has no conceptual improvment over that of Jäger
(2013), and more generally fails to cite modern and old relevant work
and position itself wrt to relevant work. It makes no advance (or even
mentions) any of the modeling challenges existing such as partial
cognacy, global (all words) vs local (per word) scoring of sound
correspondences, deep vs shallow cognacy, pairwise aligment vs
multiple alignment etc etc and the implications for the presented
algorithm. It is also deceptive in that it fails to mention a
parameter epsilon until in the appendix. It is not an innocuous
parameter since it is related to the size(s) of the wordlists.

Most deplorable of all is that they do with heuristics what was
achieved a decade ago with a much more elegant model with global
scoring and absense of a threshold by Ellison (2007).

Correspondences. Proceedings of Ninth Meeting of the ACL Special

* p 28

There seems to be some confusion of what uniformitarianism, rates and
process mean. If the process is the same but the rates change, then
process is the same and did not change. Uniformitarianism usually
means the assumption that the process does not change, which is an
assumption since there are observations from the present but not from
the past.

* "Based on this data, researchers have argued about the unity or
diversity of Tasmanian languages, with perhaps the most widely
accepted opinion being that linguistic analysis can lead at most to
rejecting the idea that Tasmanian languages constitute a single
linguistic family (Crowley and Dixon, 1981)."

"By using a combination of methods from evolutionary
biology—prominently, phylogenetic inference—Bowern was able to gather
enough evidence for 4/5 groupings (tentatively referred as
macro-families) present in the wordlists that correspond somewhat with
earlier archaeological classifications,"

"Not only did the usage of methods from evolutionary biology allow
Bowern to determine the number and extension of putative genealogical
groups among the Tasmanian languages, but, more importantly, the usage
of those methods lead to a natural quantification of uncertainty—so,
for instance, while the evidence for a common ancestry of two of the
inferred groups (those from Bruny Island and Oyster Bay) is strong,
the estimate of the common root age is extremely imprecise, ranging
from anywhere from 2,000 ybp to 20,000 ybp or more."

These three passages are completely mistaken. The philological work
by Dixon & Crowley 1981 is very similar to Bowern (2012) it's just that
Bowern (2010) probably did a more thorough job (one has to hope, the
data is not in the paper). The conlusions are very similar too, the
only difference is that the strictly quantitative aspects ended in
Dixon & Crowley 1981 with cognate density figures. Just like Bowern
the reserve judgment on many of the worst attested doculects (Bowerns
extended analysis only applies to the subsets with more than 100
items).

All the conclusions in Bowern (2012) quoted in the paper at hand can
be reached with accurate figures of the pairwise cognate desnities and
permutation tests. The phylogenetic methods used by Bowern (2012) were
used wrongly, in ways the present paper warns against. Structure has a
model of admixture which obviously incorrect for the evolution of
linguistic data (where we have trees, as also argued in the paper)
rather than random sampling from a number of pools. (Only in the case
of source mixing may this warranted, and that does concern a few
Tasmanian vocabularies, but that does not motivate its usage for
questions of descent, e.g., inferring the number of families.)
Furthermore the K is not compared to the prior in Bowern (2012)
application and so it not warranted solely by the data anyway.

The number of genealogical groups among the Tasmanian languages was
reached by Bowern (2012) with elementary means: simply "too few
cognates" uniting all groups that are not arguably borrowings/recent
introductions.  If she had followed the phylogenetic method she
(mis)applied the conclusion would indeed have been that they formed
one family spoken 20000 to 2000 years ago. Not 5 families, one family.
Not one family with such and such uncertainty concerning the number
one, but one family with full certainty, only a lof of uncertainty
about its age. That's what the phylogenetic methods she applied says,
but sensibly, she choose to ignore that conclusion (as it springs from
a misapplied monogenetic model, though the does not say that out loud).

* p 31-32

The experiment is flawed in that it removes languages like Old Prussian
because it does not show bimodality. Either find the error is the supposed
method or the theoretical property of the data of these languages that mean
they do not apply.

* The so-called North Caucasian family consists of languages in
North-East Caucasian family only.

Comments to the Author
This paper outlines methods and workflows for using large datasets to
perform phylolinguistic analyses. With some reorganization and adjustments
to the writing, this will be a very valuable contribution to the Journal of
Language Evolution. Below are some general comments regarding the
organization and writing of the article. Further detailed comments are
included in the attached file.

In general the writing of this piece tends toward the verbose end of the
spectrum, which in some places muddies the message being presented. I
recommend that the author(s) aim for maximally clear and concise text in
the revision process, especially in sections that present background
information. Some specific comments on writing and typos are included in
the attached file.

The extent to which individual technical terms and concepts are explained
is quite variable and may not in all cases be appropriate for the  target
audience. Some linguistic concepts that most people interested in language
evolution will be familiar with are fleshed out in great detail (e.g. the
notion of basic vocabulary as a more reliable source of phylogenetic signal
than other areas of the lexicon - p. 6), while other terms (including
technical terminology central to the methods discussed) are used without
being clearly introduced and defined (e.g. "pre-alignment", which appears
by p. 9, but is introduced with small caps and sketchy definition only on
p. 12).

The introduction section provides plenty of general background on
phylolinguistic traditions and their relationships to biology, but at the
expense of clearly introducing the content of the article -- namely, the
use of specific computational methods for answering questions in historical
linguistics using large datasets. I recommend condensing the discussion of
the history of phylogenetics and outlining the main focus of the
contribution within the first paragraph or two.

The issues of orthographic representation and level of phonetic detail are
discussed briefly in Section 3.2, and are then re-introduced and discussed
in further detail in Section 3.5. Between the two is a lengthy discussion
of alignment, scoring, tree reconstruction, and statistical tests. This
organization seems disjointed, particularly because the issue of sound
representation is so important to the matter of alignment. I recommend
consolidating the discussion of representations and presenting all
theoretical discussion relatively early in Section 3 (perhaps in the
beginning of Section 3.2, or in a new section in that vicinity). The IDS
example might make more of an impact if it referred back to a single,
concise discussion of representational issues instead of including its own
lengthy introductory discussion of these issues.

Section 3.7 seems out of place and wordier than it needs to be. The point
that computational methods can supplement or assist with traditional
historical linguistics has already been made, including the notion that
they can be used to overcome data limitations (e.g. the  Bowern reference
on p. 13). As the admixture model and NeighborNet methods central to Bowern
2012 aren't directly discussed in this article, it seems like an odd
example to devote so much space to. I would reconsider whether this section
is necessary at all, especially since Section 3.8 segues abruptly back to
methodological matters.


On page 2, lines 26-29 it is argued that 'individual sound-meaning correspondences encoded as lexical roots' might be particularly prone
to homoplasy. Insofar as sound-meaning correspondences are arbitrary (i.e. excluding things like iconicity), we might expect relatively low
rates of homoplasy in these items. Typological features of language might be a clearer example to use to illustrate the notion of homoplasy in 
linguistic traits.

Page 2, line 41: the term "neutral traits" is used. I interpret this to mean traits that are neither benificial nor detrimental to an
individual w.r.t. selectional forces, but I am not confident that this is the interpretation intended by the authors. I recommend clarifying
this, particularly for the benefit of readers who may not have extensive backgrounds in evolutionary theory.

Page 5, line 30: What do you mean by "the more distant languages"? I could imagine this being true for poorly attested languages, and languages
in families where the general level of documentation is poor.

Page 6: The idea of automatic cognate detection is discussed in several paragraphs on this page. You may want to consider referencing List, Greenhill,
and Gray (2017) The potential of automatic word comparison for historical linguistics. PLoS One 12(1): e0170046. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0170046.
That paper provides a good discussion of the problem of computational detection of cognates and compares some methods for doing so.

Page 6, lines 14-25: The discussion of Swadesh lists ignores their shortcomings, specifically non-universal nature of some meanings (e.g. dog, generic 
tree), semantic relationships that may influence forms of multiple items (e.g. moon/night, red/blood), noun-heaviness, etc.A reference to 
an article discussing some of this would provide some balance. One article that illustrates many of these issues is Hoijer (1956) 
Lexicostatistics: A critique. Language 32(1): 49-60. I suspect there are more recent pieces that would also suffice.

Page 7, lines 10-11: Since you are discussing graphemes (orthographic units), and not necessarily different phonemes here, shouldn't you use angle
brackets such as <k'> instead of the combination of phonemic notation slashes and parentheses currently used?

Page 7, lines 14-16: Leaving the sequences of characters to be handled later leaves the reader wondering, at this point in the paper, how this will
be resolved. A reference to where it is resolved would be useful.

Page 7, lines 25-28: This is the first mention of the term "scoring model" in this section, I believe. Because this is a very important concept
for this section I recommend that you introduce it in caps (in keeping with other technical terms), and provide a brief definition. Alternatively
the term could be introduced in the first paragraph of the sub-section, since it is indeed the focus of this sub-section.

Page 9, lines 12-15: What evidence supports this claim that there is sufficient signal in real cognate pair alignments for correct sound
correspondences to be identified in spite of some false positives/wrong alignments?

Page 10, lines 31-33: I infer that "gaps" here has to do with insertions/deletions, but the reader has no way of knowing exactly how this
term is being used; I recommend making the intended meaning clearer.

Page 10, lines 31-37: The reader may be left wondering about situations where one sound/symbol in language A corresponds to two in language B
(e.g. Spanish puerta - Italian porta, or instances where two symbols correspond to a single sound in one language). This is one of the reasons 
that I recommend consolidating the discussion of representational issues and being more explicit about what "gaps" are in this method.

Page 14, figure 5 caption: I don't think the last sentence ("Note that although only a small detail...") is necessary given the descriptions
earlier in the caption.

Page 14, lines 44-45: The "regular correspondences" you refer to here are the same as the "table of regular correspondences" you mention on
line 41 of page 12, correct? I suspect that some historical linguists will expect that all uses of the term "regular" in relation to sound
changes/correspondences will mean "regular" in the strict Neogrammarian sense. It would be good to be explicit somewhere in this sub-section
about whether "regular correspondences" does in fact mean "exceptionless" as in the Neogrammarian usage.

Page 16, lines 11-25: This paragraph is a bit dense, and might be easier to read if some of the ideas were rephrased or "unpacked" a bit.

Page 17, lines 13-17: There seem to be some missing references here.

Page 17, lines 29-33: It is not entirely clear what this sentence means, or how to evaluate the claim here without knowing exactly what you
mean by 'random' mutations in this linguistic context. Do you mean sporadic changes? Either some clarification or a reference to some supporting
discussion would be very helpful.

Page 20, lines 40-48: The permutation test in linguistics dates back to Oswalt (1970) The detection of remote linguistic relationships. Computer
Studies in the Humanities and Verbal Behaviour 3: 117-129. It was also discussed in great detail in Kessler (2001). The significance of word
lists. CSLI Publications. Diachronica papers by Haynie (2014) and Dunn and Terrill (2012) have also used permutation tests to assess relationships.
Any of these references would be good additions to this background on permutation tests.

Page 34, line 48: I cannot find any information on the EHL website cited here on the work being done there on semantic shift. If it is not possible
to cite outcomes of that work it may be preferable to omit the discussion of that work in progress.

Page 36, line 55: Though analogical change is sometimes treated as a "garbage bin" of marginal, non-regular changes, the phenomenon is really
not that rare (certainly not in the same class of unusual "phonetic processes" as metathesis, though of course metathesis can happen by 
analogy...). Non-regular does not mean rare. Nor is it the case that analogical changes are inherently non-regular. It's a little unclear,
therefore, exactly what you are trying to single out here as being poorly handled by these methods.


Awkward wording:

Page 3, line 9: "with the help of"

Page 6, lines 27-32: This sentence is long and difficult to parse without a second reading. I recommend rewording it.

Page 8, line 46: "Another example is *due to* Heggarty"

Page 9, line 8: "part of the cognate pairs"

Page 11, line 26: Word boundaries aren't really an 'imperfect proxy' for syllable boundaries. Rather, they are a restricted subset of syllable boundaries
that are recoverable from orthographic representations.

Page 13, lines 33-36: "the enrichment of cognates"

Page 13, line 41: "while the comparison of probabilistic models" -- do you mean the "alternative"?

Page 13, line 43: These methods aren't equivalent from a traditional historical linguist's perspective, and probably wouldn't deserve any
lengthy discussion as alternatives if they were truly equivalent. Perhaps a different word choice or a modifier on "equivalent" would make 
more sense here.

Page 18, line 28: Do you mean "typographical errors"? As written, the meaning of this sentence is unclear.

Page 18, line 47: I understand the meaning you intend with "sound difference", but "patterns of sound change" might be preferable wording.

Page 19, line 47: "It should be noticed" (recommended: "It should be noted")

Page 20, line 17: "Let us flesh out with more detail a concrete example." (recommmended: "...flesh out a concrete example in more detail.")

Page 24, lines 51-52: The final sentence of this paragraph needs to be reworded for clarity.

Page 28, line 24: "After the settlement of British settlers in the island (...), native population experienced..."

Page 28, line 26: "...with different accounts differing in..."

Page 29, line 30: "To obtain the dates of unknown events from the dates of a few known events needs a model..." ("requires a model"?)
